# SiRA Refund Policy

## Policy

SiRA will generally attempt to honor any reasonable request for refund; however, SiRA is under no obligation to fulfill any request for refund.

## SiRA Membership

SiRA is a membership organization with members that pay annual dues. Refunds will only be made in the event that:

* a membership transaction was duplicated, or
* an auto-renewal was processed and refund is requested within 7 days.

## SiRA Events

SiRA will host Events from time to time, including but not limited to: webinars, SiRAcon, trainings, seminars, etc. These events may be offered for free to the public, for free to members, for a cost to public or members, or some combination thereof.
Unless posted otherwise for a specific event the below is SiRA's refund schedule.

### Event Registration

Some SiRA Events will have defined timelines around registration and refund deadlines. For example, "early bird" discounts, member discounts, student discounts, registration cut-offs, etc. Virtual Event registration will generally cut off on the day of the event. In-person events may have registration cut-offs in advance of the event. Refunds will similarly have a cut-off in advance of the event, usually around the time that final seating counts must be provided to facilities, caterers, etc. 

### Event Refunds

If a registered attendee for a SiRA Event is unable to attend, and does not wish to transfer their ticket/seat to another individual, they may request a refund for the originally paid registration expense, taking into account any discounts that may have been in effect. As long as these requests are received within any stated timeframes for the event, SiRA will attempt to honor these requests and issue a refund **to the original payment method** that was used to make payment. Any refunded amounts will be minus any transactional fees (e.g., credit card transaction fees) that may have been charged for the original payment, and minus any additional fees that may be charged as part of processing the refund.

If a request for refund is not made within the stated timeframe for the event, SiRA may still choose to issue a partial refund as a courtesy to the registrant.

Ticket transfers may occur up to five (5) days prior to the event. Transfers should be directed to the organizers of the event, for example <siracon@societyinforisk.org>, <events@societyinforisk.org>, or <webinars@societyinforisk.org>.

### Refund Timetable

Events often have several types of registrations. These generally include: 

* early-bird pricing: available until 90 days before the event
* member pricing: a discounted price for current and paid members of SiRA
* complimentary: generally provided to speakers, SiRA board members, event organizers/volunteers, and vendors and their guests as part of sponsorship packages

Event refunds will generally be honored as follows:

* 30+ days ahead of the event: 100% refund, minus applicable fees.
* 14-29 days ahead of the event: 50% refund, minus applicable fees.
* 13 days or less ahead of the event: no refund

Timing for completing a refund will vary, and is on a best-effort basis.

## Refund Requests

Requests for refund should generally be directed to the organizers of the event, for example <siracon@societyinforisk.org>, <events@societyinforisk.org>, or <webinars@societyinforisk.org>. As a last resort, or if you are unsure who to contact, please reach out to <board@societyinforisk.org> or <payments@societyinforisk.org>.
